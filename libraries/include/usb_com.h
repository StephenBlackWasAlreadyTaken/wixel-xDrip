 * The states of these lines are controlled by the USB Host.
 *
 * The default values are RTS=0 and DTR=0.  In Windows, when a typical
 * terminal program opens the COM port, both RTS and DTR go to 1.  When
 * the program closes the port, DTR goes to 0 but RTS remains at 1.
 *
 * The bits of this byte are defined in com.h:
 * - Bit 0: #ACM_CONTROL_LINE_DTR
 * - Bit 1: #ACM_CONTROL_LINE_RTS
 * - Bit 2-7: Reserved (should always be zero)
 *
 * Example:
\code
if (usbComRxControlSignals() & ACM_CONTROL_LINE_DTR)
{
    // DTR is 1, which traditionally means the DTE (host) is present.
}
else
{
    // DTR is 0, which traditionally means the DTE (host) is not present.
}
if (usbComRxControlSignals() & ACM_CONTROL_LINE_RTS)

    // RTS is 1, which traditionally means "Activate carrier" or
    // tells DCE (device) to prepare to accept data from DTE (host).
}
else
{
    // RTS is 0, which traditionally means "Deactivate carrier".
