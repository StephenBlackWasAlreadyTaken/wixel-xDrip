/*! \file adc.h
 * The <code>adc.lib</code> library provides functions for using the CC2511's
 * Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).  The ADC can measure several
 * different things, including voltages on any of the six Port 0 pins, the
 * voltage on the VDD line (the 3V3 pin on the Wixel), and the temperature.
 *
 * The ADC has 14 channels:
 *

 * \section channelparam The channel parameter
 *
 * Most functions in this library require a channel parameter to
 * specify which channel to use.  The value of this parameter should
 * be one of the channel numbers in the table above.
 *
 * You can also use the bitwise OR operator (|) to specify advanced options
 * in the channel parameter:
 * - By default, VDD is used as a reference but you can use the internal
 *   1.25 V source as a reference by specifying #ADC_REFERENCE_INTERNAL
 *   in the channel parameter.
 * - By default, the maximum ADC resolution (12 bits) is used, but you can
 *   use a different resolution by specifying #ADC_BITS_10, #ADC_BITS_9, or
 *   #ADC_BITS_7 in the channel parameter.
 *
 * \section adccfg The ADCCFG register
 *
 * The CC2511F32 datasheet says that to configure a pin on Port 0 to
 * be used as an analog pin, the corresponding bit in the ADCCFG
 * register must be set to 1.  However, we have not found this to be
 * necessary, and this library does not touch ADCCFG.
 *
 * If you want to follow the datasheet, then you could write to ADCCFG
 * at the beginning of your program with some code like this:
 *
 * \code{.c}
 * ADCCFG |= (1 << 3);  // Enable ADC input on P0_3.
 * \endcode
 *
