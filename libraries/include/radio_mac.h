/*! \file radio_mac.h
 * The <code>radio_mac.lib</code> library takes care of sending and
 * receiving packets.
 * It handles the details of setting up the radio interrupt and
 * DMA configuration.
 * It uses <code>radio_registers.lib</code> to configure the radio.
 *
 * When a radio-related event happens, <code>radio_mac.lib</code>
 * reports the event to higher-level code by calling radioMacEventHandler()
 * in an ISR.  The higher-level code can then decide what to do next by
 * calling radioMacTx() or radioMacRx() from the event handler.
 *
 * This library does not currently support any way of turning off the
 * radio to save power.
 *
 * This library defines an ISR, so radio_mac.h must be included in the
 * file that defines main() in order for this library to work.
 *
 * This library uses an interrupt.
 * For this library to work, you must write
 * <code>include <radio_mac.h></code>
 * in the source file that contains your main() function.
