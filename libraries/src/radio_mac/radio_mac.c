/*  NOTE: Calibration of the frequency synthesizer and other RF hardware takes about 800 us and
 *  must be done regularly.  There are several options for when to do the calibration and not.
 *  We configured the radio to automatically calibrate whenever going from the IDLE state to TX
 *  or RX (MCSM0.FS_AUTOCAL = 01).  The radio will go into the idle state whenever the is an RX
 *  timeout.  However, to enable a quick turnaround between TX and RX, we configured the radio to
 *  automatically go into the FSTXON mode after it is done with RX or TX mode.  FSTXON means that
 *  the frequency synthesizer is on and the radio is ready to go into RX or TX mode quickly
 *  (but it goes to TX mode faster).
 *
 *  So basically we are depending on the RX timeout feature to schedule our calibrations for us,
 *  instead of doing it manually.  This should work, but it will probaby hinder our ability to
 *  quickly recover from lost packets (the RX timeout event is what happens when a packet is lost).
 *  An easy alternative would be to only calibrate after every 10th RX timeout or something like
 *  that.
 */

/*  The definition of the maximum packet size (and the code that sets the PKTLEN register) is not
 *  in this layer.  That is up to the higher-level code (radio_link.c) to decide.   When this
 *  layer needs to know the packet size (for setting up the DMA), it reads it from PKTLEN.  This
 *  makes the code a little less efficient because it takes longer to access an XDATA register
 *  than a hardcoded constant, but makes this MAC layer much more reusable.
